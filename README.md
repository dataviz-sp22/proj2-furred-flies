Furred Flies (Caleb Weis, Eva Wu, Jimin Han)

This file explains the structure of the repository. This file will
include our write-up.

## Repo organization

-   [proposal](proposal) folder. This folder includes the RMarkDown and
    knitted MarkDown documents which contain the information in this
    proposal.

-   [data_cleaning_description](data_cleaning_description) folder. This
    folder contains RMarkDown documents used to load, examine, and
    wrangle data from the RAQSAPI and to load data from other sources,
    the csv files of data loaded from other sources, as well as the
    README file consisting of the codebook.

-   [shiny](shiny) folder. This folder contains Shiny documents used to
    construct our data visualization. (We have yet to learn how to use
    Shiny, so some other documents may be included in this folder as
    well.)

-   We have a README.Rmd and README.md file for each folder. These files
    explain the structure of the repository. The README files in the
    main directory will include our write-up.
